                    Hi, I'm Cal and thank you for visiting my website!  I am a budding developer who enjoys many things outside of coding.  Brewing subpar but drinkable beer, fumbling through woodworking projects (imperfections add character!) and gaming (board and video) are among my hobbies.  I have experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python.  I hope you enjoy this site and my prpjects.  Feel free to send me message below if you have any questions or comments about my websites.
